Majestic at scale, grandeur in VFX, and great blend of sci-fi & mythology taken at an eye popping level. Proud moment indeed for Indian cinema that stands tall as a mega mountain.

Director Nag Aswin takes us through three different "never seen" worlds. First half is a bit drag with comedy elements and build up. Editing could have been better.

Second half elevates to "PEAKS" with spectacular action sequences, strong story and crisp screenplay. Pre-interval and climax is a hair riser, and giving audience plenty of goosebumps.

Prabhas is at his usual coolness and delivers. Deepika Padukone emotes well and binds to her character. Kamal's getup and dialogue delivery will stun you. There are plenty of surprises in terms of star cast.

Sir Amitabh Bachchan outweighs every other character and is the heart of the whole movie. His stature, voice, caring attitude & protective nature, and breathtaking action scenes will be remembered by all ages.

Terrific BGM & technical aspects, and deeper mythological connection with a strong plot in second half will make audience go gaga.

True cinematic triumph, and there will be a giant sea swell in the box office!
